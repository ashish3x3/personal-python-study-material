cannot download directly..
so go to unofficial site http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy

download numpy-1.11.2rc1+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl and scipy-0.18.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl

numpp+mkl bcz skipy needs it for its dependency. so first install numpy then skipy

NOTE: have saved a copy of both of these file in this folder too

downlaod this file locally
store it in c:\>python27

run :
pip install C:\Python27\numpy-1.11.2rc1+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl 
Successfully installed numpy-1.11.2rc1+mkl

then

pip install C:\Python27\scipy-0.18.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl
Successfully installed scipy-0.18.1

cp27 tells its for python2.7 so dont download any .whl with cp33 as that will be for python3.x etc

also amd64 tells if U r running 64 bit python version...in most cases amd32 wil work like above numpy,scipy example. so download 32 version amd only
